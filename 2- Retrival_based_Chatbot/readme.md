In this notebook, we implement a retrival-based chatbot, which is trained to provide the best possible response from a database of predefined responses using ML techniques.

To code this project, I used Patrick Loeber's video on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpWeNzfSUHw

**Let's see a sample conversation!**

```
Let's chat! (type 'quit' to exit)
You: Hi
bot: Hi there, how can I help?
You: Are you selling coffee?
bot: We have coffee and tea
You: Do you accept AMEX?
bot: We accept VISA, Mastercard and Paypal
You: My last question, how long does the delivery take?
bot: Shipping takes 2-4 days
You: perfect. Thank you!
bot: Happy to help!
You: bye
bot: See you later, thanks for visiting
You: quit
```
